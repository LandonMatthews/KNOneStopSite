KN One Stop is a place of convenience, there at the best moment
when you're out on the road, but ALSO a place to go for a quick-shop when you're
living nearby. Basically a convenience to end all conveniences (But not really
because we know well that we're not the only one out there.). We'll serve you what
you need, as long as you show common courtesy. We have gas to refill the car, food if you
or any little ones are hungry, and all other sorts.

<br>
And that should be it. Thank you for taking time to read this.
